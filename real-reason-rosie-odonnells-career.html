In September 2016, Chelsea was <a href=#>hospitalized for an alleged drug overdose</a>.</p><p>In May 2017, Chelsea gave another interview with the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>, accusing O'Donnell of being verbally abusive and of threatening her with physical violence. Chelsea said she secretly married boyfriend Nick Alliegro after discovering she was pregnant. When the couple suffered a miscarriage, Nick claimed O'Donnell "never seemed to care or even asked any questions, like it didn't matter to her."</p><p>O'Donnell denied Chelsea's allegations, telling the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>, "Chelsea is mentally ill. [She] has been in and out of hospitals most of her life. Born addicted to heroin. She has had a tough road. As for her comments, I assume you are paying her, which is why she is selling these tales to you... She is very sick. She is not capable of truth or reason." O'Donnell added, "As a mother, my request is that you not pay her and leave her alone... It is comforting to know she is still alive, so thank you for that part."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmam1hbH9wvsSao2aqlZbAsLqMq6asoZVivKW7zaecpaSjYrCivsSeqWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
