It's pretty high, which is unsurprising given that, in his glory days, he was one of the world's highest-paid actors. Per&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>,&nbsp;at his peak, he was earning "$15-$20 million per movie," reportedly making $20 million for 2007's&nbsp;Fred Claus&nbsp;and $17 million for&nbsp;The Dilemma.&nbsp;According to&nbsp;<a href=#>Forbes</a>, he was even once had one of the highest "Ulitmate Star Paybacks," in other words, bringing in the most money on the lowest budget. Impressive! Although some might argue those days are over, Vaughn recently starred in the gritty&nbsp;<a href=#>Brawl in Cell Block 99</a>, so perhaps he's here to stay. All in all, Vaughn's bank account reportedly boasts $70 million.</p><p>Real estate-wise, Vaughn went all-out in the Midwest. According to&nbsp;<a href=#>Curbed,</a>&nbsp;he owned a massive 12,000-square-foot penthouse in Chicago, which took up the top three floors of the historic Palmolive Building and&nbsp;<a href=#>reportedly</a>&nbsp;was home to Hugh Hefner! He bought it for $12 million, "the priciest condo sale in Chicago history," per the outlet. Wow! In 2011, he listed the stunner for $24.7 million, which he then dropped to $13.7 million in 2015, according to&nbsp;<a href=#>POP SUGAR</a>.&nbsp;He sold it a year later. Then, in 2018, Vaughn sold his 1950s Traditional-style Hollywood Hills home (which he bought from Kate Bosworth) for nearly $2.5 million, per&nbsp;<a href=#>The Los Angeles Times</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that a Wedding Crashers sequel is in the works (Vaughn confirmed the news to <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2020), there's a good chance his already impressive net worth will get a big boost soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma29mZ4N2e8eeqZ6rXZ28uHnMrpqhZaaeu6SxjK%2BYrp%2BYo3qqv4ywpqusmGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
