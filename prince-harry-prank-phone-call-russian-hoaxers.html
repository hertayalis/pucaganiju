The phone calls reportedly took place on New Year's Eve and January 22. Per Good Morning America, Kuznetsov and Stolyarov have previously pranked the likes of Elton John and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Based on transcripts from the British media, Harry opened up about why he decided to step back from the royal family and why marrying into the monarchy has its downside.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Sometimes the right decision isn't always the easy one, but it was the right decision for our family. I think there's a hell of a lot of people around the world that can identify and respect us for putting our family first. It's a tricky one, but we will start a new life," Harry reportedly said during the conversation. "I can assure you marrying a prince or princess is not all it's made out to be. There's lots of layers to it and lots of pieces to the puzzle."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The duke continued to assure that even though it was a difficult decision <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a30445491/meghan-markle-prince-harry-step-down-royal-family/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="to step away from the royal family" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">to step away from the royal family</a>, he and Meghan seemingly have no regrets.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Oh no, I think it's much better," quipped Harry. "You forget, I was in the military for 10 years so I'm more normal than my family would like to believe."</p><img alt="Commonwealth Day Service 2020" title="Commonwealth Day Service 2020" width=2432 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-harry-duke-of-sussex-and-meghan-duchess-of-sussex-news-photo-1583947097.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Chris Jackson</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Aside from commenting on his upcoming new chapter, Harry also reportedly shared his opinions on President Donald Trump and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a29860128/prince-andrew-stepping-down-royal-duties/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="his disgraced uncle" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">his disgraced uncle</a>, Prince Andrew.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The phone call hoax marks yet another breach of the royal's privacy, especially after he and Meghan have been vocal about feeling violated by the press and mistrusting the British tabloid media.
