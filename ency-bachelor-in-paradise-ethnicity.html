So, Ency Abedin sure did make a splash down at Playa Escondida... pun 100 percent intended. You may not remember Ency from her time on Clayton's season of The Bachelor since she was sadly eliminated in week 2. Now, she's back and ready to find love (and get more screen time) on Bachelor in Paradise!"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Right away, she had eyes on Andrew and, after only one date, stole him away from Jessenia, which is quite a feat considering Jessenia is a catch! But you know what, so are all the women down in Mexico (... sadly can't say the same about the men but *insert shrug emoji here*).</p><p>Let's get acquainted with our new bestie, Ency!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Ency Abedin's ethnicity?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Ency was interviewed by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bachelor Nation</a> back in May to celebrate Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. In the interview, Ency opened up about her family emigrating to the U.S. as well as her connection to her heritage.</p><p>She said, "What makes me proud to be a member of the AAPI community is the confidence I have gained in representing my heritage/community. Throughout my adolescent years, I was insecure and shy about my heritage due to the racism I received. Growing above that and now sharing my experiences as a pillar to connect with others in the AAPI community has brought me lots of joy and strength."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ency has a tight-knit relationship with her family.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Ency has a close relationship with her father. On her dad's birthday, she captioned the above post:</p><p>"Wishing the happiest of birthdays to the #1 man in my life. I don't know how I got so lucky to have you as my father, but I am so grateful for everything you have done for me. Thank you for showing me unconditional love every single day of my life. You have taught me that there is no greater love than a father's love for his daughter. I love you so much Daddy."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Ency is very close with her sister, Ella, as well. She posted a picture on Instagram to celebrate Ella graduating high school earlier this year, saying, "You’re sky high on various achievements and for sure mom and dad's favorite now. I can’t wait to see what you’ll do with your future my chipoodle. Now go kick ass in your chosen university and continue being the boss babe I know you for."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What else is there to know about Ency?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Ency graduated from UC Irvine with a degree in Global/International Studies.
