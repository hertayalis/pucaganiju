The “Teenage Dream” singer found herself in hot water with “American Idol” fans on Sunday after she was allegedly disrespectful towards another singer following the elimination of her favorite contestant, Elijah McCormick.
Perry, 38, and the other judges were thrown for a loop during Sunday’s three-hour episode after voters failed to push McCormick, 21, through to the Top 20."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

First of all, shook by the results, and I’m also shook by that song is so dramatic.”</p><p>“There’s so much drama going through my body right now I need a nap,” continued Perry. “But the truth is, America, you guys have the votes. You’re the ones voting and if you’re not voting, you’re not using your voice. Your faves aren’t safe. So from now on, vote for who you want to see in the Top 12.”</p><p>Once again, “Idol” fans were not happy with Perry, calling out her lack of feedback for Ani.</p><p>“Katy Perry needs to apologize to We Ani immediately!
