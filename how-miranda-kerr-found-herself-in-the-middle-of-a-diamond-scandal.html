Low was a high-flying businessman until his role in the massive 1MDB embezzlement scheme was uncovered. Per the Washington Post, Low is accused of stealing billions of dollars from a Malaysian government-owned development fund, called 1MDB. The scheme landed former Malaysian prime minister and 1MDB co-founder Najib Razak in prison on corruption charges (per Reuters), while Low has been on the run for his part in the plan since 2018."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

His extravagant gifts to her included a heart-shaped diamond pendant worth $4.5 million, and a pair of earrings that retailed at $1 million. If receiving jewelry from a man since accused of being the mastermind of a major scandal wasn't enough, the diamonds weren't the only gift Low gave to Kerr, whom he reportedly dated for only a year. She also&nbsp;received a custom-built, see-through grand piano. According to <a href=#>The New York Times</a>, such a piece could cost anywhere from $170,000 to more than $1 million.</p><p>Per <a href=#>Page Six</a>, Kerr wasn't the only celebrity Low was using his ill-gotten gains to get close to; the financier also gifted Leonardo DiCaprio priceless Hollywood memorabilia.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcm9oaYV5e8eormalmaeur7DAZqKeqqJis7DBzZ1koZ2iqLKtsoyipWasmJp6rrXDnaOeZZ%2BbeqJ5w6KYpqeemXq0r8Cnm5qkXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
