My childhood years found me needing treatment for numerous orthopedic injuries. This, alongside work with large and small animals in injury settings as a teen, sparked my desire to become a doctor. My med school/ post-grad UCSD years fostered my fascination with 'Praxingenium', a wordplay for the genesis and plasticity of human function, ascribed by mentor Vern Nickel, MD, Ex-Director of the Rancho Los Amigos Nat'l Rehabilitation Center. In 1988, with an interest in gleaning a foreign perspective of, and furthering my skills in Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation, I was afforded a Fellowship in Knee, Shoulder and Sports Trauma in Lyon, France. Fortuitous as this already was, it led to my first job as Physician and Surgeon to the French National Men/Women's Alpine Ski Teams of the French Ski Federation, for the1989-1990 World Cup season. This unparalleled collegial learning experience continues to this day, and paved a way for me to immigrate to America and Jackson, Wyoming, whence I set up my first Orthopedic Sports Medicine practice. During the ensuing 25 years, I had the invaluable fortune of collaborating with smaller community hospitals in the Greater Yellowstone Basin of Western Wyoming, Eastern Idaho and Southwestern Montana, and studying with and befriending Ron Losee, MD of Ennis, MT (from the fame of ‘Doc: Then and Now with a Montana Physician’) through the last 25 of his practice years and end of life events. In 2012, I moved to the San Francisco Bay area to raise my family. I joined Scott Dye, MD's practice and share his obsession with, and teaching of anatomo/bio/mechano/physiology principles, or 'Envelope of Function' of the knee; a Godsend. The passion I have for healing, coupled with an empathic desire to offer the best in innovative treatments for your orthopedic injuries, is my "Joie de Vie".</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbvXoqSirKljsLC5jqmsm2eTnb%2Bqv9OimKdll6q2pr6Mppt4q5ikxKC5zqucdqyiqrI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
