If you read my Homemade Zucchini Bread recipe from years ago, I recipe tested so much zucchini bread to perfect the recipe. 
I wanted a bunch of picky 12-year-olds to try out Zucchini Bread for the first time and they were highly suspicious."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They were very open about their disdain for any green vegetable so they definitely didn’t want to try a baked good with zucchini in it! But after some positive peer pressure from one of the girls, they all tried it.</p><p>Thankfully, they ALL loved it and came back for seconds! The zucchini bread was devoured in no time at all.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Zucchini-Muffins-3-scaled.jpg alt="The Best Zucchini Muffins makes with fresh zucchini which makes the muffins extra moist!

You won't even know there is zucchini in these muffins because they taste that good." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>I wanted to make the Zucchini Bread into Zucchini Muffins because of the portability factor. When my kids were toddlers, I made zucchini muffins all of the time for them. I would keep them in the freezer so when we were heading out to the zoo, a children’s museum, or running errands, I would take the homemade zucchini muffins out of the freezer, place them in Ziploc bags, and they were perfect for them to eat. I loved making them more nutritious muffins than what you can find at the grocery store!</p><p>While we are on the subject, one of my favorite healthy breakfasts to feed my four kids is my <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>homemade HEALTHY PANCAKES recipe</strong></a>, which are naturally gluten and dairy free. I can’t tell you how many parents have told me that they feed these to their two and three year old kids every single day. I love to hear that kids are loving them!&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Zucchini-Muffins-5.jpg alt="The Best Zucchini Muffins makes with fresh zucchini which makes the muffins extra moist!

I have used both butter and oil in my zucchini muffins and found the oil creates the moistest muffins. I also use a mix of brown sugar and sugar which helps to create a chewy texture and the sugar helps to create a sugary top.</p><p>This homemade zucchini muffins recipe calls for a mix of cinnamon and nutmeg. Some people like a lot of spice in their zucchini bread. I prefer it to be lightly spiced so if you are a cinnamon lover, please feel free to add more! Pure vanilla extract really makes a difference in the flavor of this zucchini bread.</p><p>I use a box grater to grate the zucchini and leave the peel on. I just wash the zucchini and give it a good scrub to make sure to remove any dirt and pesticides. Cut off the ends and grate the rest of the zucchini. I would suggest trying to remove some of the moisture from the zucchini by soaking it up with a paper towel or using a cheesecloth to squeeze out some of the moisture.</p><p data-slot-rendered-dynamic=true>I bake my zucchini muffins in this <a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B001IANICS data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow><strong>aluminum muffin tin</strong></a>and it helps to cook them evenly.

Give it a good wash and scrub to remove dirt and pesticides. Grate the zucchini and make sure to firmly press down the zucchini in the measuring cup to get an accurate measurement. Try to remove some of the moisture from the zucchini (but not all of it) by squeezing it in a paper towel or cheesecloth.</li><li><strong>Use your favorite type of oil</strong>. I usually reach for canola oil since it has a very neutral flavor profile and doesn’t compete with other flavors. You may also use vegetable oil or possibly extra-virgin olive oil. EVOO may offer a stronger flavor to the muffins, especially if it isn’t super fresh.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Bake for 18-22 minutes depending on the size of the muffins.&nbsp; </strong>If the muffins are browning too quickly, I will usually tent the foil to allow the muffins to keep cooking on the inside without them becoming too brown. The tented foil allows them to rise in the center. For a sugared top, during the last 10 minutes of cooking, carefully sprinkle sugar all over the muffins. You can also do this ahead of time, before placing the muffins in the oven.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Let cool to room temperature before removing from the pan</strong>. To expedite the cooling, I will put the muffins into the freezer for about 10 minutes to allow them to firm up. Serve the zucchini bread muffins with sweet cream butter.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>POPULAR ZUCCHINI RECIPES:</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>ZUCCHINI BREAD</strong></a></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>CHOCOLATE ZUCCHINI BREAD</strong></a></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>FROSTED CHOCOLATE ZUCCHINI CAKE</strong></a></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Zucchini-Muffins-Recipe.jpg alt="The Best Zucchini Muffins makes with fresh zucchini which makes the muffins extra moist!
