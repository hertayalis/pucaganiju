When she appeared on South Korean TV show&nbsp;Radio Star&nbsp;in 2017, JooE revealed that she went under the knife when she was still a high school student&nbsp;— and lied about it during her audition.&nbsp;</p><p>"I used my ear cartilage to heighten my nose, but I was upset because you couldn't really tell,"&nbsp;she added (via <a href=#>AllKPop</a>). "I got the surgery done when I was a freshman in high school, but I heard people say that I'm a celebrity who was prettier before debut." JooE opened up about her surgery again the following year when she appeared on the variety show, Knowing Bros (via&nbsp;<a href=#>Koreaboo</a>), telling host Heechul (of Super Junior fame) that part of her ear "went on an adventure" to her nose. "If I pick my nose, I'm also picking my ear," she joked.&nbsp;</p><p>When Momoland performed at the&nbsp;Soribada Best K-Music Awards in 2019, JooE looked even less like her pre-debut pics, leaving numerous people convinced that she'd undergone double eyelid surgery.&nbsp;"Strangely, we can still recognize the face she had before," one pleasantly surprised fan said (via <a href=#>Koreaboo</a>). "It came out so naturally." The idol has remained tight-lipped over the eyelid surgery rumors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhjaIZxe8pmp6ioXajBor7SZqelmaOptqR50q6poJ2irnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
