"It's actually embedded into your DNA," says Dr. Rolanda Wilkerson, principle scientist for Head & Shoulders. "Fifty percent of the population is predisposed to dandruff." However, that doesn't make managing an unbalanced scalp any less annoying.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Luckily, we tapped Dr. Wilkerson, along with none other than Bill Nye the Science Guy, who is currently partnering with Head & Shoulders, to share everything you need to know about dandruff, from how it starts, to how keep it under control.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-causes-dandruff></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Causes Dandruff?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We'll let Nye take it from here.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Dandruff can easily be explained by science! I call it the dandruff triangle – there are three sides, just like dandruff," he shares. "On one corner there is me (or you), then there is the oil in your skin, and lastly there is the ol' malassezia globosa fungus — yes, it's a fungus that lives on your head and in the little follicles or your hair. It takes in oil from your skin and makes your scalp shed its cells like crazy. That is dandruff. I'm not a fan."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Neither are we, Bill.

Flakes caused by dryness are normally smaller and will appear more white. However, dryness can lead to dandruff, according to Dr. Wilkerson. So it's a good idea to use medicated products on wash day when you start noticing signs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"An anti-dandruff shampoo, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Head & Shoulders Classic Clean</a>, can work wonders in the way your scalp looks and feels, even if you don't feel you have full on dandruff," she shares.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$6; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>walmart.com</a></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-some-ways-to-manage-dandruff></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are Some Ways to Manage Dandruff?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"First and foremost, use an anti-dandruff shampoo," says Nye. Head & Shoulders is also his go-to. "I'm even confident enough to wear my snazzy black lab coat, because I'm flake-free."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Some other options include <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Nizoral Anti Dandruff Shampoo</a>, as well as Head & Shoulder's Royal Oils Moisture Boost Scalp Care Shampoo, which is ideal for anyone with natural, afro-textured hair, as the formula is extra moisturizing.

"It fights the dandruff-causing fungus while cleaning your scalp, leaving your head clean and free of flakes."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: What To Eat For Healthy Hair & Nails</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-does-using-manual-tools-like-an-in-shower-scalp-brush-help-to-relieve-flakes></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Does Using Manual Tools, Like an In-Shower Scalp Brush, Help to Relieve Flakes?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eh, the answer to this one isn't exactly straightforward. However, so long as you don't overdo it (which can actually make things worse), these types of tools can definitely help to alleviate existing flakes on the scalp.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It might be someone's first thought to scrub away the flakes, but gentleness is key," Dr. Wilkerson advises. "Using a very gentle in-shower scalp brush, or an exfoliating scrub, can help exfoliate and relieve flakes. However any harsh scrubbing — even scrubbing with your fingernails — can inflame the scalp and cause irritation to worsen."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x5qgq2eUlrulvtSfnWabkarApr%2BMramemaSisq%2FAjJugpaRdo8am</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
