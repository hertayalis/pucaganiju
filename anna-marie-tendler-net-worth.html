John and Olivia share one child.</p><p>In the wake of her divorce, Anna was in a fragile place. But years later, she’s turning heartbreak into success with her first tell-all memoir, Men Have Called Her Crazy. So, what is Anna Marie Tendler's net worth before the memoir's publication?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram / @annamtendler</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Anna has an estimated net worth of $5 million.</h2><p>Anna is a multidisciplinary artist and author. She graduated with an M.A. in fashion and textile history from NYU’s Costume Studies program. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to her website</a>, her master’s thesis “explored the recent history of lip filler and the sociocultural politics of female aesthetics as analyzed through medical texts and popular cultural discourses.”</p><p>While some argue that art doesn’t pay the bills, Anna has proved the naysayers wrong.<strong> </strong>Her net worth is reported to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$5 million</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Anna was married to John Mulaney.</h2><p>Anna married the Saturday Night Live Comedian in July 2014.

More accurately though I have been writing it for close to four decades. I have never been more proud of any work.”<strong></strong></p><p>She went on to express the main topic: "It is a story about mental health; about being a woman; about family. And finally, about the endless source of my heartbreak and rage—men.”</p><p>If you need a refresher, Anna struggled publicly with her mental health in 2021. At the time, she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared</a> that she was “heartbroken” about "John’s decision to end their marriage.”</p><p>The situation got messier when it was reported that John was dating actress Olivia Munn just days after the divorce was revealed. That following September, Olivia and John announced they were expecting their first child together.</p><p>The next year, Anna published an essay in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle</a> where she revealed that she suffered a mental breakdown in December 2020, shortly before her and John’s divorce was announced.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Anna Marie Tendler (@annamtendler)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram | @annamtendler</a></figure><p>She credited her beloved dog, Petunia, for never letting her “out of her sight” and being her reason to carry on.</p><p>“Petunia and I moved to Connecticut in December 2020, in the wake of my severe mental health breakdown and what appeared to be the impending end of my marriage,” Anna wrote.</p><p>“My mental health hinged wholly on my dog," she said.</p><p>"When I was hospitalized for depression, self-harm, and severe suicidal ideation in the first two weeks of 2021, the doctors asked me to make a list of my reasons for living," she explained.
