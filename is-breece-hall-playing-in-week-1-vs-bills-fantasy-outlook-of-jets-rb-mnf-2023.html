While he began training camp on the Physically Unable to Perform (PUP) list, he made a notable return to practice by Aug. 15. His progress is promising, pointing towards a potential return in the Jets’ 2023 opener.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Jets_RB_Breece_Hall_Fantasy_Impact_Analysis_vs_Bills><strong>Jets RB Breece Hall: Fantasy Impact Analysis</strong> <strong>vs. Bills</strong></span></h2><p><br>The shadow of Hall’s injury might affect his explosive playing style, at least initially. Fantasy football managers need to weigh the risks and rewards. The addition of Dalvin Cook to the roster complicates matters, suggesting that the Jets might distribute the workload between the two backs.</p><p>Given the uncertainties, a conservative projection might place Hall at 50-60 yards rushing, with potential added value in PPR formats if he’s involved in the passing game.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Is_Breece_Hall_a_Viable_Fantasy_Option_for_MNF_2023><strong>Is Breece Hall a Viable Fantasy Option for MNF 2023</strong>?</span></h2><p><br>Considering the competition in the backfield and his recent return from injury, it might be risky to depend on Hall as an RB1. However, in deeper leagues or as a flex play, he might provide value. If your league is standard-sized, and you have better, proven options, it might be worth benching Hall for Week 1. However, if you’re in a deeper league or require a flex play, Hall might be worth the gamble.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Alternative_Fantasy_Options_at_RB_for_MNF_2023><strong>Alternative Fantasy Options at RB for MNF 2023</strong></span></h2><p>While Hall’s recovery has been positive, the Jets may prioritize his long-term health over immediate gains. The presence of Dalvin Cook also allows the team to manage Hall’s snaps strategically.</p><p><br>Dalvin Cook, also on the Jets’ roster, is an obvious alternative, especially since his role is yet undefined. Outside the Jets, exploring other matches for the week may yield other suitable RB candidates for MNF.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Final_Thoughts><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></span></h2><p><br>The excitement surrounding Breece Hall’s return is palpable. Yet, fantasy football managers should exercise caution in Week 1, considering both the competition in the Jets’ backfield and Hall’s return from a significant injury. The matchup against the Bills isn’t easy, but Hall’s potential cannot be ignored. Weighing the pros and cons will be crucial for fantasy success.</p><p><strong>People Also Read:</strong></p><p><a href=#>60+ Lamar Jackson Fantasy Names for 2023 [Funny, Creative, and Original]</a></p><p><a href=#>70+ Josh Allen Fantasy Names for 2023 [Funny, Creative]</a></p><p><a href=#>70+ Jalen Hurts Fantasy Names for 2023 [Funny, Creative, and Original]</a><span contenteditable=false></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FtcbHoq2eZpOkunC6xaVmoqtdl7%2BmscKeZKGZnKF6sbjAsqCnn12eu27DxJ6iZmldq8Bursilo6xllpa7ta3SsmSoraShvLC3jKidZqKVqcBuvsFmpKeeXWd9c3%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
