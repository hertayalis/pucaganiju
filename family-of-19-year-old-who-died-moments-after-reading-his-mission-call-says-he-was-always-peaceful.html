We’ve been to waterparks, in gyms working out, just doing our vacation, and there was no sign of anything,” Rebeccah Mildenstein said.</span></p><p><span>Instead of focusing on how he died, the family is now celebrating how he lived, calling him a “gentle bear.”</span></p><p><span>“He was always peaceful in every circumstance. He loved Christ and he loved the Gospel,” Jared Mildenstein said. “The biggest thing about him is that he was a writer and a storyteller. He really liked being in the message of things and getting his point across.”</span></p><p><span>The family is finding comfort in knowing he is in a better place and believes he is serving that mission on the other side.</span></p><p><span>“He was called right there to go to work on the other side and we know he’s there,” Rebeccah Mildenstein said.</span></p><p><span>The Mildensteins are grateful for the support from the community and said that love is helping them get through this difficult time.</span></p><p><span>“There has been global outreach of people trying to show their love and support for him and us, and we are grateful. We can’t even comprehend everything that’s happened,” Jared Mildenstein said.</span></p><p><span>The family told KSL they are planning memorial services for their son in Provo and plan to bury him with his mission tags that are being sent to them by the Church.</span></p><p><span>A <a href=#>GoFundMe* account</a> was set up to help the family with the unexpected funeral costs.</span></p><p>*KSL TV does not assure that the money deposited to the account will be applied for the benefit of the persons named as beneficiaries.
