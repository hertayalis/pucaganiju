Since he first arrived on screens in 1954, the colossal character has mesmerized fans of all ages. With the latest Godzilla film,&nbsp;Godzilla vs. Kong,&nbsp;doing well at the box office, it seems that the beast will never fall out of popularity.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=463 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=true>If you’re looking to buy a gift for the kaiju fan in your life, it can often be hard to know where to start. Over the Godzilla franchise’s long history, there have been loads of different products bearing the sea monster’s likeness, from the cheap to the mind-blowingly expensive. If you’re looking for some quick gifts this holiday season, here’s a rundown of this year’s best gifts for&nbsp;Godzilla&nbsp;and Toho fans.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false>10. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Godzilla vs. Evangelion – Type-3 Kiryu EVA Unit-01 Color Ver. Model Kit</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Godzilla-Eva-Model-Kit-1.jpeg><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=684 data-injectable=true>If you know someone who loves both&nbsp;Neon Genesis Evangelion&nbsp;and&nbsp;Godzilla, then this is the perfect gift for them. This model kit features the Type-3 Kiryu Mechagodzilla from the Godzilla x Mechagodzilla&nbsp;movie from 2002. Rather than the gunmetal grey version seen in the film, this one is painted in the iconic color scheme of EVA Unit-01 from&nbsp;Evangelion.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>While it may seem like an odd combination at first glance, it does make sense when you think about it, as Hideaki Anno⏤the visionary behind&nbsp;Evangelion⏤directed the critically-acclaimed&nbsp;Shin Godzilla&nbsp;in 2016. The resulting model also makes a lot of sense, as it’s hard to deny that Mechagodzilla doesn’t look great in this striking color palette.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=747 data-injectable=true>The kit itself stands at an impressive 9.5 inches tall, making it an excellent display item. While the construction process is on the more complex side, it isn’t too hard to build, and would be a fantastic project to work on during long winter nights. The result is really worth it, making this the perfect gift for any mecha and kaiju fan in your life.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false>9. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Godzilla Movie Musical Monster Moving Electronic Coin Bank</a>&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Godzilla-Bank.jpeg><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=730 data-injectable=true>Electronic grabbing banks are a charming novelty item that can be found in many different styles. At first, this box may look like a calm ocean vista, complete with a small boat bobbing on the waves, but if you put a coin on top of the bank, the iconic Godzilla theme will begin to play as Godzilla rises up from the water. Godzilla then lets out his famous roar before grabbing the money and dragging it down into the bank.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=303 data-injectable=false>The Godzilla model used in this box is really detailed and charming, and the box’s movements are also really smooth, making it fun to watch. This is made better by the box having several different routines, meaning you get a slightly different experience whenever you offer the kaiju a coin.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>A cute way to make saving money fun, this bank is a fun stocking stuffer for&nbsp;Godzilla&nbsp;fans who are looking to inject a little whimsy into their financial affairs.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false>8. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Godzilla: Unnatural Disasters</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Godzilla-Unnatural-Disasters.jpeg><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=678 data-injectable=true>Godzilla doesn’t just dominate the big screen. The character has also appeared in many popular comic series that use the iconic kaiju to tell new and unique stories.&nbsp;Godzilla: Unnatural Disasters&nbsp;collects three of IDW’s most popular Godzilla comic miniseries⏤Godzilla: Legends, Godzilla In Hell, and&nbsp;Godzilla: Rage Across Time⏤into one book.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=443 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>Legends&nbsp;tells the story of several of Godzilla’s most famous foes, including the lesser-seen Titanosaurus and Kumonga.&nbsp;Godzilla in Hell, as the title suggests, sees the giant monster go on a rampage in the underworld, likely one of the only environments where he’s at a disadvantage. Finally,&nbsp;Rage Across Time&nbsp;goes back in time to look into the myths that led to the creation of Toho’s famous kaiju.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=219 data-injectable=false>Each of these miniseries tells a different story and features loads of unique and highly-detailed art, making it the perfect entry point for those who want to dive into&nbsp;Godzilla’s&nbsp;comic adventures.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false>7. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kidrobot Godzilla Phunny Plush</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Godzilla-Plush.jpeg><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=257 data-injectable=false>Who doesn’t want to give Godzilla a hug? Now, thanks to toy company Kidrobot, you can! Its Phunny Plush Godzilla is 8 inches tall and features embroidered details. The design is ridiculously charming, featuring a goofy face and cute chibi-style limbs.</p><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=559 data-injectable=true>This is the perfect gift for Godzilla fans who are looking for something different from the norm. It’s also great for&nbsp;Godzilla&nbsp;fans with young children, as the toy is soft and durable and won’t look out of place among other stuffed animals, even those without atomic breath.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false>6. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Tamashii Nations Figures</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Godzilla-FIgure.jpeg><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=627 data-injectable=true>Tamashii Nations is one of the leading names in premium figures, statues, and collectibles. The company makes tie-in products for loads of anime, video games, and movies. The name has become associated with highly-detailed, dynamically-posed, and beautifully-painted figures that are several steps above your average Funko Pop.</p><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=428 data-injectable=true>Its&nbsp;Godzilla&nbsp;line does not disappoint. In fact, many Tamashii Nations fans argue that its kaiju figures are the company’s best, as the strange anatomy and detailed hides allow Tamashii Nations’ attention to detail to shine through.&nbsp;The products’ range includes a stunning King Ghidorah, several forms of Godzilla, Biollante, and even a Jet Jaguar based on the new&nbsp;Singular Point&nbsp;anime.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>5. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Godzilla: Tokyo Clash</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Tokyo-Clash-1.jpeg><p data-characters=631 data-current-count=931 data-injectable=true>Released as part of Funko’s move into the board game field, this game was designed by Prospero Hall, the team behind a load of popular licensed board games.&nbsp;This game sees players take the role of either Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah, or Megalon as they battle for supremacy across Tokyo. The game’s board is a modular cityscape, complete with little buildings you can smash and crash through as you build up power and prepare to take the battle to your foes. On top of this, each kaiju has a unique deck of cards, meaning that you’ll need to change your strategy depending on who you are playing as.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=227 data-current-count=227 data-injectable=false>Tokyo Clash&nbsp;is great for both&nbsp;Godzilla&nbsp;lovers and board game fans. It has enough depth to keep you coming back for more while also being simple enough that the whole family can dive in and have a good time.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false>4. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Shine Humidification King Godzilla</a>&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Godzilla-Humidifier.jpeg><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>Godzilla has fought many beasties over his long and illustrious career, and now he can fight your dry air. The Shine range of Godzilla humidifiers are, as the name suggests, humidifiers that use a jet of water mist to increase your room’s humidity.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=553 data-current-count=813 data-injectable=true>What sets this one apart from the pack is that it’s actually shaped like Godzilla. To make it even better, the mist comes out of Godzilla’s mouth, making it look like the monster’s trademark atomic breath. When you start the humidifier, it plays the classic Godzilla theme and roars.&nbsp;A second version based on Burning Godzilla from&nbsp;Godzilla vs. Destoroyah&nbsp;also exists. This version uses red LED lights to make the mist appear red, allowing you to recreate Burning Godzilla’s legendary super-powerful breath attack.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>3. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Toho SFX Movies Authentic Visual Books</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Godzilla-Book.jpeg><p data-characters=470 data-current-count=770 data-injectable=true>Sold exclusively via Godzilla Store Tokyo, these books are a fantastic gift for&nbsp;Godzilla&nbsp;fans. Each of the books focuses on one monster, and the pages are packed with behind-the-scenes information, photographs, and details about the special effects. The highlight of these books has to be the shots of the kaiju suits wandering around the miniature city sets, as they give you a whole new appreciation for the cast and crew behind these legendary movies.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>While the text is in Japanese, most of the content is pictures, so even English-speaking fans will find something to love. One of the best things about this series is that it features volumes focused on often-overlooked Toho movies and characters. If you know a fan of Gorosaurus, Dogora, or even the Toho version of Frankenstein’s Monster, this series is a must-buy.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>2. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reyn Spooner x Godzilla Aloha Shirts</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Godzilla-Shirt.jpeg><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>While Godzilla-branded clothing isn’t new, it usually stops at basic T-shirts bearing the kaiju’s image. Toho and Reyn Spooner teamed up to produce these brilliant Aloha shirts. Each shirt has a unique print that pays tribute to a classic&nbsp;Godzilla&nbsp;film, including one based on the fan-favorite&nbsp;Mothra vs. Godzilla.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=641 data-injectable=true>Each shirt features classic moments from the film recreated in Reyn Spooner’s signature style, and the clever use of color means that the shirts look great at a distance and up-close. If you want something more fashionable than usual nerd wear, these shirts are an excellent choice.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false>1. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Criterion: Godzilla: The Showa-era Films, 1954–1975</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Godzilla-Showa-Set.jpeg><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=682 data-injectable=true>This collection is essential for&nbsp;Godzilla&nbsp;fans, and while they’ll no doubt know the films already, this collection will let them appreciate them in a totally new way.
