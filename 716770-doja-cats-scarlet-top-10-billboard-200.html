The news comes after her song, "Paint The Town Red," already went number one on the singles chart. It was her second song to do so.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-doja-cat-performs-at-the-vmas>Doja Cat Performs At The VMAs</h2></span><p>Doja Cat performs onstage at the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards held at Prudential Center on September 12, 2023 in Newark, New Jersey.

This is even reflected in her cover art choice, which she says represents overcoming her fears. She defended the artwork, which features two spiders, in an interaction with a fan on Twitter, earlier this week. "The art I chose for my album is beautiful and I like it a lot," she wrote. "The two spiders signify conquering your fear. None of my album covers had meaning until this album. You not accepting me was a fear I used to have. I don't care anymore about satisfying you."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-doja-cat-s-scarlet-heads-for-big-debut>Doja Cat's "Scarlet" Heads For Big Debut</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Scarlet is Doja Cat's first album since 2021's Planet Her. She began promoting the project with the release of the singles "Attention," "Demons," and "Balut." She'll be embarking on The Scarlet Tour along with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ice Spice</a> and Doechii later this year. The first show is set for October 31, 2023, at Chase Center in San Francisco and the last will be held on December 13, 2023, at United Center in Chicago.
