After that, he joined the Springfield Indians, and stayed for half of the 1976-1977 season, before he became a part of the Cincinnati Stingers. He played for them until 1979, which certainly increased his net worth.</p><p>After that, he split time between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Detroit Red Wings, before he joined the Adirondack red Wings of the AHL, and retired in 1987.</p><p>Soon after his playing time was over, Barry became the head coach of the Medicine Hat Tigers of the WHL, and won the Memorial Cup title with the team.

His next coaching job came in 2008, when he became head coach of the Tampa Bay Lightning, but after only 15 games, he was fired.</p><p>Apart from coaching, Barry works as a commentator and analyst for both ESPN and NHL Network. He first joined ESPN in 1996 and stayed on with the Network until 2008, but after he was fired from Tampa Bay, he re-joined the ESPN.
