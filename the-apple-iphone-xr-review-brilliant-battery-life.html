The only difference is that the iPhone XR eschews having a telephoto lens – meaning the phone won’t be able to have as high a quality of zoomed in photos as its more expensive XS siblings.</p><p>We can quickly verify the picture quality results against the iPhone XS:</p><p><a href=# id=a_one><img alt="Click for full image" id=i_one src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/galleries/6902/IXR_IMG_0014_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><br><strong>[</strong> iPhone XR <strong>] -</strong> <strong>[</strong> iPhone XS <strong>]</strong></p><p><a href=# id=a_two><img alt="Click for full image" id=i_two src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/galleries/6902/IXR_IMG_0017_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><br><strong>[</strong> iPhone XR <strong>] -</strong> <strong>[</strong> iPhone XS <strong>]</strong></p><p>In both images, the results are virtually identical. This was to be expected, but it’s always good to verify!</p><p>Overall, rather than repeating myself here I'm going to refer to the camera section of the iPhone XS review, as all of my analysis there is also valid for iPhone XR – minus the telephoto module, of course.</p><h3><a href=#>The iPhone XS&nbsp;Camera Review</a> - Historic iPhone comparisons</h3><p>Similarly, for readers interested in a broader, more contemporary camera comparison, I'm going to refer to the camera comparison in our Google Pixel 3 review. It contains the most up-to-date camera comparisons across 2018 flagship phones, including results of the iPhone XS against the newest Android competition.</p><h3><a href=#>The Google Pixel 3 Review</a>&nbsp;- Most recent full competitive camera review</h3><p>Overall – the iPhone XR camera shines in the same way the iPhone XS camera did: Apple’s absolute strength here is in terms of picture consistency and the assurance that essentially every shot will come out the same in the best possible way.</p><p>Key to making this happen was that this generation’s main camera sensor saw big improvements in terms of resolving details – thanks to the bigger sensor with bigger pixels, as well as the much improved DTI (Deep trench isolation) which is able to reduce noise and improve sharpness. Apple’s new HDR system is also a big upgrade for the new iPhones, as it manages to capture a much greater dynamic range in virtually all scenarios. Low-light performance of the new iPhones is also good – although Apple doesn’t use some of the new-fangled computational photography magic that is now standard on Huawei devices, and was most recently adopted by Google’s Pixel phones.</p><p>Another aspect of the camera that is understated for the new generation of phones is an absolute huge jump in video recording quality. Here the dynamic range in video recording has seen immense jumps – and together with Apple’s first-time introduction of stereo audio recording, actually makes the new iPhones, including the XR, what I find to be the best smartphones on the market for video recording.</p><p>The lack of a telephoto lens on the XR is something that needs to be subjectively evaluated based on your experience and needs. On one hand, I do find it quite useful and a feature I would probably miss – but on the other hand it’s also not something that I find to be a deal-breaker or represent a key deciding factor when having to choose between different smartphones.&nbsp;It’s a feature that augments the camera experience, but one can also live without it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH50hZBrZq2glWKusbzLnmSiqJiku6Z516tkq52mnrK4ecGroKWkmZa7tXnBmqutnaKueq21xZ5mbw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
