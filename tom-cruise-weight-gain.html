With the release of Top Gun in 1996, his career reached dizzying heights, and the then-24-year-old still had much of his boyish charm and thin face.</p><p class=root-block-node data-paragraphid=4 data-from-init=true data-changed=false>While some admirers speculated that he had acquired weight for a film part, others simply laughed it off and wished the actor to be himself.

When I spotted you in the stands during the Dodgers game, I was very disappointed! Another user responded, Stop shoving garbage in your face!"</p><p data-paragraphid=4 data-from-init=true data-changed=false>Also, his uneven dentition, which saw one front tooth aligned with the center of his face, drew criticism from admirers. Tom's face was beginning to shift, and he appeared chubbier on occasion, probably as a result of weight fluctuations. However, Tom is yet to make any comments regarding his weight gain and swollen face.</p><h2 data-paragraphid=4 data-from-init=true data-changed=false>Tom Cruise’s Children: The Actor Is the Father of Three Kids!</h2><p class=root-block-node data-paragraphid=3 data-from-init=true data-changed=false><strong>Tom Cruise</strong> has been married to <strong>Mimi Rogers</strong>, <strong>Nicole Kidman</strong>, and <strong>Katie Holmes</strong>, all of whom are actresses.
