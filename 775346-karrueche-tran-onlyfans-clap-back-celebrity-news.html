However, those who choose to participate in sex work or selling salacious content online tend to face more harsh judgement than others. This is especially true if they've already amassed a fortune through other avenues. We've seen <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Cardi B</a> and Rubi Rose specifically be <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">called out</a> for failing to flaunt too much of their famous figures for subscriber's enjoyment. Now, it's Karrueche Tran who's feeling the heat after launching a profile full of photos of her feet.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">When the Los Angeles native first shared the news with her Twitter followers, it wasn't long before <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Chris Brown</a>'s name came up in conversation. Breezy was recently caught double-tapping a photo of Tran on Instagram, and now, fans are hoping he'll save the 35-year-old from a career on OF. Besides the discourse about her ex, others are speculating that Karrueche might be going through hard financial times, perhaps explaining her decision to sell foot photos and videos for $25/month.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-karrueche-addresses-those-hating-on-her-for-securing-the-bag>Karrueche Addresses Those Hating on Her for Securing the Bag</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Rather than let the haters hate, Tran got a few things off her chest in a post-and-delete on Tuesday (March 12). "LOL at all the comments regarding OF. I'm not going broke," she assured those concerned about her bank account. "Just a smart play, foot fetish is the number one fetish in the world. There's nothing sexual that will be on my page. It's literally my feet and if people are willing to pay, then what's the problem?"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As Karrueche strives to prove that you <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">don't need to strip naked</a> to become a mainstay on OnlyFans, other celebrities are pushing the limits on the platform. For example, the late <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Juice WRLD</a>'s former partner, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Ally Lotti, is currently under fire</a> for selling things like the rapper's dreads and bodily fluids to fans online.
