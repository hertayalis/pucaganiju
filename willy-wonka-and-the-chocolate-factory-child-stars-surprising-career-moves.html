The movie would be Peter's only acting credit, as the child star declined an offer of a three-movie contract instead returning to Cleveland, Ohio.</p><p id=eLRZlqM4IJ data-wc=76>The child star was not bitten by the acting bug one bit, and instead devoted his career to veterinary medicine. After heading to Germany, his family acquired a horse, and during a routine visit from a vet, the young boy's interest was piqued.
