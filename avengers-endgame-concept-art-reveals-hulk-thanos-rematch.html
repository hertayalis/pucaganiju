One shows what you might call the Iron Family – Iron Man, Rescue, War Machine and Spider-Man – blasting through the sky, while another captures a moving kiss between Tony and Pepper on the battlefield. The most satisfying, though, has to be the concept art of Smart Hulk finally getting the better of the Mad Titan with a mean right hook.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/avengers-endgame-concept-art-hulk-thanos.jpg><p data-characters=493 data-current-count=493 data-injectable=true>We know that there was a heck of a lot of material that never made it into the finished cut of&nbsp;Endgame, ranging from abandoned subplots that never got past the script stage – <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scarlet Witch and Rocket road trip</a>, anyone? – to key sequences that were ultimately removed due to test screening reactions – <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katherine Langford’s cameo</a> as a teenage Morgan Stark. It’s unclear how far along the process this battle between Hulk and Thanos got though before it was junked.</p><p data-characters=431 data-current-count=431 data-injectable=true>Of course, this is just one of the many ways that Hulk’s arc changed over the course of Infinity War&nbsp;and&nbsp;Endgame.&nbsp;Originally, the merging of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hulk and Banner happened in</a> IW&nbsp;before it was held off for Endgame.&nbsp;Drafts were written featuring scenes which explored how Smart Hulk was created as well, but ultimately, the writers decided to throw viewers in the deep end by introducing him without any explanation (see above).</p><p data-characters=146 data-current-count=146 data-injectable=false>Tell us, though, do you think a Hulk vs. Thanos fight should’ve happened in<strong>&nbsp;Avengers: Endgame</strong>?
