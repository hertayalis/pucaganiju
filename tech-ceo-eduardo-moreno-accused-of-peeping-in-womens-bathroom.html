The CEO of a Silicon Valley startup was arrested Monday on suspicion of peeping on a woman inside a Panera Bread restroom, authorities said.
Police in Mountain View identified the suspect as Eduardo Moreno, the 35-year-old co-founder and chief executive officer at SeaDrone, a Palo Alto-based company that offers underwater ship hull inspections.
According to a police press release, at around 11:40 a.m. Monday, a 911 call came from a woman reporting that she had been inside a restroom at the Panera Bread eatery on El Monte Avenue when a man stuck his head underneath her stall."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>
