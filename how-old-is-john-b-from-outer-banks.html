The show was an instant hit with audiences, topping the Netflix charts and quickly earning a season two renewal. Though he spends most of his screen time navigating teenage problems, leading man Stokes hasn’t been a teen for quite some time. But just how old is he?</p><h2 id=h-how-old-is-chase-stokes data-injectable=false><strong>How old is Chase Stokes?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/chase-stokes-2022-power-of-young-hollywood-celebration.jpg><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=638 data-injectable=true>While John B is 17 on the show, Stokes is now 30 years old and will be turning 31 in Sept. 2023, making him 14 years older than the character he plays. He’s also older than the actors who play his fellow Pogues. Rudy Pankow (JJ), who recently appeared in Uncharted, is 24 and both Jonathan Daviss (Pope) and Madison Bailey (Kie) are 23.</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Madelyn Cline</a>, who plays John B’s love interest Sarah Cameron (a Kook-turned-Pogue), is 25 and was last seen in Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery in the role of <a href=#>Whiskey</a>.
