The couple also opted to do the same for their daughter Princess <a class=hm-link href=#>Charlotte</a>, and we can only presume for little Prince Louis too.</p><p id=eVFtFrVQHNGj data-wc=45>Naturally, Marcus was overjoyed, and said, "I'm proud that we can suit everybody. That's what we want IKEA to be – for the many people of the world, both royalty and ordinary people." It is believed the couple selected the mainstream brand for its durability.</p><p id=ehamNSWjSKro data-wc=12>We can only wonder what Kate and William’s own bedroom is like!</p><h2>Royals with unusual living arrangements</h2><h3>King Charles and Queen Camilla's separate bedrooms</h3><p id=ep8h7Dzk5S data-wc=24>The Waleses aren't the only royals with unconventional bedroom habits. In fact, <a class=hm-link href=#>King Charles</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Queen Camilla</a> are reported to sleep in separate rooms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9db85e973747-charles-camilla-airport.jpg><p id=etoEPYvpnB data-wc=54>The royal couple<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;reportedly have three bedrooms</a>; one each and one to share. As depicted The Crown, it is believed the late Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip did not sleep in the same bed, or even the same room, which originally raised the belief that royal couples don't share a bed.</p><h3>Zara Tindall and Peter Phillips living with mother Princess Anne</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6f2ef5fefe53-peter-zara.jpg><p id=en8nEBBVBXe3 data-wc=48><a class=hm-link href=#>Zara Tindall</a> <a class=hm-link href=#>lives on the same estate</a> as her mother <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Anne</a> and brother <a class=hm-link href=#>Peter Phillips</a>. It might be a nightmare scenario for most people, but the living arrangements at Gatcombe Park clearly work for the close-knit family - and the 730 acres of land probably help too.</p><p id=eN3pu0yMpl data-wc=71>Reflecting on how amazing growing up at the Gloucestershire property was, Zara said: "It was a great place to grow up around horses, looking after animals - the respect and partnership that you have to build with the animals, it teaches you so much you know growing up and as a kid. It really is an amazing life starting to be outside as well, you know, all the time," she said.</p><h3>Sarah Ferguson living with ex-husband Prince Andrew</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7be01ffb4a7a-sarah-ferguson-prince-andrew.jpg><p id=eDm1pGohoQ data-wc=53>Perhaps the most unique living situation of all is Sarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew <a class=hm-link href=#>living together following their divorce</a>. The former couple called it quits in 1996 but have remained living at Royal Lodge in Windsor together and are on great terms for the sake of their daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.</p><p id=e7ZrREF1dz data-wc=64>Proving they're the friendliest of exes, the duo even look after the Queen's late corgis together. The Duchess of York told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Telegraph</a>. of their unusual arrangement: "All I can say is that we’re happy with the way we are right now,. We always say we are the most contented divorced couple in the world. We’re divorced to each other, not from each other.</p><p id=eKIIf-VL3ZS data-wc=10><strong>PHOTO:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Kate's childhood living room is just like ours</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eArIHs71C7a data-wc=40>"We are co-parents who support each other and believe that family is everything.
