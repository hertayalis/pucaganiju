It is so much easier to make healthy food choices when you aren’t starving.</li><li><span><strong>Start shopping in the perimeter of the store.</strong></span> Start in the produce department and fill your cart with fresh fruits and vegetables. Focus on natural whole foods. Spend the least amount of time in the very center of the store where most of the processed foods are.</li><li><span><strong>Make a grocery list ahead of time.</strong></span> This keeps you on track and saves you from wandering the store and filling your cart with junk food.

Que the tears.&nbsp; I am trying to get her prepared so we downloaded the OptUP App. I want to teach her how to use it before she does her own grocery shopping. Since she is a ridiculously healthy eater and basically gets super excited about a veggie tray and a bowl of fruit, this will help her continue to make healthy choices. Grocery shopping on her own will be completely new to her so this OptUp App will help keep her on track.</p><p>You can download the app on the <strong>AppStore</strong> — <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>OptUP App</a></strong>&nbsp; or Google Play. Once you download the app, login or set up an account and you will get a household score. Kroger is giving away a $100 gift card so once you get your score, leave me a comment sharing your score, and Kroger will randomly choose a winner. How fun would it be to have $100 to spend at the grocery store?</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/How-to-Make-Healthy-Choices-at-the-Grocery-Store-8.jpg alt="How to Make Healthy Choices at the Grocery Store.
