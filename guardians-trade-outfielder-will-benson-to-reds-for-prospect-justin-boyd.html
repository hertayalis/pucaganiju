In an attempt to add outfield depth and impact hitting to their lineup in 2023, the Reds acquired outfielder Will Benson from the Guardians for Justin Boyd and a player to be named later. Boyd was a 2022 supplemental second-round pick out of Oregon State and debuted last summer. 
The move clears 40-man roster space for the Guardians. Benson found himself on the outside looking in among a deep Guardians outfield group, but should find opportunities on the other side of Ohio."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

A three true outcomes hitter, Benson was productive despite low batting averages due to his power and on-base ability. Entering 2022, Benson made adjustments and began to make contact at an average or better rate. He noticeably did this without sacrificing his plus power or on-base skills. This led to a .278/.426/.522 slash line and a significantly improved strikeout rate of 22.7%. An athletic slugger with the ability to play all three outfield positions, Benson should factor into the outfield picture in Cincinnati this spring.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=blue-text><strong>GUARDIANS ACQUIRE</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><a href=# class="player-linker-link mce-player-linker">Justin Boyd</a>, OF</strong><br><strong>Age:</strong> 21&nbsp;</p><p>A standout at Oregon State, Boyd hit .373/.490/.577 during his draft spring, impressing the Reds enough to be selected in the supplemental second round. While Boyd struggled at the plate in his pro debut, his contact was about average. Boyd possesses a broad skill set with feel to hit, athleticism and instincts that should allow him to play center field. Boyd struggled against velocity in pro ball, particularly when elevated, but those issues could be fixed with tweaks to his swing.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o63SnpmapJyWuqa%2ByJyYZ5ufony0wM6roJ6rX5zCor7Dopinq12pv6KwxGamrqyWnrKtsMSrZLChnKF6o7HNrKanZaSkerOxw6xkn6eiYr2zu9KpnJysXZ%2FCtMDIp2Sbp6mZfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
