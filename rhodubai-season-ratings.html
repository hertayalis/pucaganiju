No cast of reality TV wants to hear that their show is boring, especially when they’re not sure if it’s coming back. Unfortunately for The Real Housewives of Dubai, that’s exactly what’s happening right now.
Although the show includes many “firsts” (such as being the first international franchise for Bravo), it seemingly hasn’t received the same warm welcome as some of its Housewives predecessors."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

During a chat about the future of Dubai, Carlos nicknamed the show “The Real Housewives of Buh-Bye,” saying that he felt like the cast had “studied every single housewife” before they booked their show.</p><p>Gizelle added that she thinks the only entertaining cast member is <a href=#>Chanel Ayan</a>.</p><p>“I’ve only seen one, maybe one and a half episodes,” Gizelle admitted on the podcast. The only thing that stands out to me is the model girl ... I feel like she’s at least entertaining to watch. The others is like paint drying.

So she needs to watch more than one episode to see what’s going on. It’s an ensemble cast. You can’t judge when you’ve only watched one and a half.”</p><p>Lesa added to her friend’s statement by expressing her disappointment in Gizelle’s take... and sense of style.</p><p>“I feel like Gizelle should actually know better, and girl, worry about your fashions first before you worry about us,” she suggested.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by gizellebryant (@gizellebryant)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">‘RHODubai’s’ ratings have gone down as the season continues.</h2><p>RHODubai kicked off on a high note when it premiered on June 1, 2022.

Yikes!</p><p>As of this writing, RHODubai’s premiere remains the show's most-watched episode. However, fans aren’t ready to give up on the series just yet. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>, some viewers believe the RHODubai cast deserves another season to prove they can succeed. Others noted that Bravo has kept other “snooze fests” like <a href=#>RHOBH</a> on for more than a decade.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Did somebody say ratings? <a href=#>#RHOA</a> <a href=#>#RHODubai</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/rmbEB2WNXj</a></p>— TV Deets (@tvdeets) <a href=#>August 3, 2022</a></figure><p>Bravo has yet to share if RHODubai will return for a Season 2.
