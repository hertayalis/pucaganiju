When Emmy tries to break down Sarah’s emotional wall, they both learn something new. <a href=#>Florence Pugh</a> has quickly risen to become an A-list prestige actor with an Oscar nomination, so her role in Human Resources is a fun pivot.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Miley Cyrus as Van the Logic Rock</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Before Sarah met Emmy, she met Van, the sexy female Logic Rock who captures Emmy’s heart. While Van operates on logic alone, Emmy tries to win Van over with her passion, falling into a relatable trap. <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> is one of the most famous singer-actors alive who only does what she loves, so her appearance as Van is a nod to how hilarious and unique the series is.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jason Mantzoukas as Ben</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>We already knew <a href=#>Jason Mantzoukas</a> has been tapped for several roles in the Big Mouth universe, most famously as bisexual kid magician Jay Bilzerian.

He asks Alice, a disability rights activist, to get dinner, duping her into thinking it’s a date. Even still, Eugene is always hilarious — many of us might recognize him as Pillboi in The Good Place and Casey in <a href=#>Loki</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Alice Wong as Alice</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>It’s me!
