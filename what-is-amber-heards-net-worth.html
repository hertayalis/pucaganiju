Recommended Videos People online took sides in the former couple’s legal back-and-forth years ago. Then, following months of discourse on various social media sites, even longtime fans eventually stepped away from the drama and turned their attention to other things. The latest step in the pair’s legal battle — which is seeing Depp sue the Aquaman star for defamation over a 2018 Washington Post op-ed — began on April 11 and rekindled interest in Heard and Depp."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Heard maintained a net worth of $8 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, up until she and Depp’s legal process concluded. Her accumulated wealth is the result of years of work in acting and modeling, starting as far back as the early 2000s. She’s since gained solid prominence in Hollywood, particularly after her debut in 2017’s Justice League as the Atlantean queen Mera welcomed Heard into the growing family of superhero stars.</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>Heard’s career slowed down somewhat in the wake of her and Depp’s contentious divorce, leading the actress to file for spousal support in 2016. She initially asked for a monthly stipend of $50,000 from Depp to cover various expenses, including rent, eating out, and pet supplies. She eventually withdrew the suit, leaving fans to further question her financial situation.</p><p data-characters=484 data-current-count=867 data-injectable=false>Following her loss to Depp in the defamation suit, Heard’s net worth plummeted. In the months since the final decision came through, Heard’s wealth has dropped from $8 million earlier in the year to a painful -$6 million, according to new figures from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. The cost of losing to Depp — and subsequently paying damages — resulted in an $8.35 million net loss for the star. This saw her net worth drop significantly and enter its current negative state.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZGir6a%2BjKGcmqqUqHqvsdNmrqiqpJ18</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
