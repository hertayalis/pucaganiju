That year, the pop icon received her first-ever Oscar nomination, in the Music (Original Song) category, for “Be Alive” from King Richard, the biographical sports drama about tennis champions Venus and Serena Williams’s father. (The award ultimately went to Billie Eilish and Finneas for “No Time to Die,” from the James Bond film of the same name.) Beyoncé opened the show with a pretaped performance of the critically acclaimed anthem from a tennis court in Compton, looking electric in a neon-yellow sequin sheer dress by David Koma. Sticking with the vibrant theme, she looked stunning at the ceremony in a sweeping daffodil-yellow gown that featured a figure-hugging construction, sweetheart neckline, off-the-shoulder taffeta cape, and matching gloves. Fittingly, she paired the centerpiece with a bedazzled tennis-ball-shaped purse and diamond waterfall earrings.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her appearance at the 2022 Oscars came after a 13-year hiatus from film’s biggest night. Before that, she’d attended in 2009 to perform a medley of musical tunes with Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, and Amanda Seyfried, and in 2007 to perform “Listen” and “Dreamgirls” with her Dreamgirls costars Jennifer Hudson and Anika Noni Rose. Beyoncé made her Oscars debut in 2005, when she took the stage on three separate occasions to perform.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/d41b366c-0c5e-4fd4-85f9-ab612540d1c4_1701099318.png alt="Headshot of Christina Perrier" title="Headshot of Christina Perrier" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Christina Perrier is a NYC-based freelance writer who covers culture and lifestyle topics.
