Recommended Videos Literally a one-of-a-kind, the One Ring card was found by an unnamed collector when opening a booster pack of Magic the Gathering: Lord of the Rings cards, as reported just hours ago by The Gamer. It was believed that the card might be found by a kid who did not comprehend its value and potentially not take care of the card â€” which would devalue it greatly."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It was believed that the card might be found by a kid who did not comprehend its value and potentially not take care of the card â€” which would devalue it greatly. However, the card business is more for adults than children these days, and the one who found this card immediately placed it in a protective card case and was able to get it officially graded.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=280 data-injectable=false>There is also already an offer of $1 million dollars for the card by Dave & Adamâ€™s Card World. They made that offer earlier this month and have recently tweeted that they spoke to the attorney of the card owner and how to contact them if anyone wants to make a larger offer.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=580 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>ðŸš¨ The One Ring Update ðŸš¨</p><p>We just spoke with the attorney of the person who pulled 1/1 The One Ring card.

Well, it means theyâ€™re significantly more affordable now.</p><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=236 data-injectable=false>They were released only a week ago and rose in price to a general listing of $480. Each box consists of 12 packs of cards and each pack contains 15 cards. So, buyers were essentially paying $40 per pack, which amounts to $2.66 per card.</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=461 data-injectable=true>Now, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">prices have dropped by over $100</a> while writing this article. We found one seller who has listed the box on eBay for just $70. Thatâ€™s $5.83 per pack, which amounts to .39 cents per card. Thatâ€™s an 85% drop in one day.</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=174 data-injectable=false>However, although some sellers will want to get rid of the boxes for a cheap price, itâ€™s more likely that the boxes will generally sell for about half their original price.</p><p data-characters=169 data-current-count=343 data-injectable=false>True fans of the game are likely happy to be able to buy the cards at more affordable prices, though they obviously wouldâ€™ve preferred that multi-million dollar prize.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZopJqfmZh6tbTEZp6arJiav6q6xmajqKqUYrynedOhnGaqmaO0tHnPmpqkZaCntqSx0manpa2dorK1ecCsZK2glWK8r7GMq6Cnn12drrR5xaKlmqScrnqjscSnZJ%2BnpaOxcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
