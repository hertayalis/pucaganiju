I price check against multiple retailers and search high and low for the best discounts. I also reached out to my HELLO! colleagues for their recommendations.&nbsp;</li><li dir=ltr><strong>Trusted products:</strong> Where possible, we included products tried and tested by the <strong>HELLO!</strong> Online team - and we only recommend something if we love it.&nbsp;</li><li dir=ltr><strong>Ratings:</strong> Where we couldn’t personally test the products ourselves, we focused on ratings from Amazon-verified shoppers - only including sale items that had been consistently rated highly for quality and value for money. All of the products had a star rating of 4.5 out of 5 and above. For more information on how star ratings are calculated, please see below.</li></ul><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b566499c5d64-echo-dot.png><p><h3 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">Echo Dot deal</h3></p><p>Echo Dots are one of those pieces of tech that you’ll honestly wonder how you lived without once you have one installed in your home.

This mean machine is the latest model they’ve released and it’s brilliant. There’s no plumbing or installation required, just a single plug and you'll have access to a chilled or piping hot water. You do have to remember to fill it up as you go though, but that's a small price to pay for instant chilled and boiling water!<br></p></li><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/de80f4c25977-kids-echo-dot.jpg><p><h3 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">Echo Dot Kids deal</h3></p><p>If your kids are anything like mine, they probably already know how to use Alexa (I always tell them off for asking the time instead of reading the clock!) the Echo Dot Kids speaker has a whole range of new child-friendly content.

It's really easy to carry and is great for cleaning stair carpets. Some customers have complained that the power cable is too short, and that when you lower it to clean under furniture, the powerbutton can easily get accidentally knocked off. If you can deal with that though, it's a great bargain to snap up in the Amazon Boxing Day sale.<br></p></li><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/92b5367353da-cerave-sunscreen-z.jpg><p><h3 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">CeraVe deal</h3></p><p>An affordable beauty favourite amongst a lot of celeb circles, CeraVe Moisturising Facial Lotion contains hyaluronic acid, niacinamide and three essential ceramides, which work to protect the skin’s barrier.

This is the 128GB model and it comes in red, blue, midnight black, purple, starlight and yellow. I have the 12 Pro edition and I’m tempted by this offer just to be able to use the cinematic video function which the pre-13 models don’t have. It also has all-day battery life and up to 20 hours of video playback.<br></p></li><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ad811edf9087-elizabeth-arden-eight-hour-cream.jpg><p><h3 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">Elizabeth Arden deal</h3></p><p>Elizabeth Arden's mighty Eight Hour cream is a beauty cupboard must - it calms, protects and hydrates skin for up to eight hours, and can be applied at any time of the day.

My son got the 2023 edition for his birthday last February, and he still gets it out to read, nearly ten months later! There are thousands of new and classic records to discover, with topics including rollercoasters, robots, movie props and gaming. The 2024 edition’s theme is Blue Planet - so it kicks off with deadly sea creatures, the world’s largest coral reefs and the most impressive shipwrecks on the sea bed.<br></p></li><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/861fa7a64eea-furby-hasbro.jpg><p><h3 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">Furby deal</h3></p><p dir=ltr>This is one Amazon deal that I added to basket myself. My kids have been wanting Furbys for ages, and when I spotted this discount I snapped up two. (The Furbys actually talk to each other, so if you do have two kids to buy for, this is a massive bonus point!)</p><p dir=ltr>Parents might remember Furbys from back in the day, (they were arguably the first fully interactive pet) and this is Hasbro’s new and improved version for 2023 - and it topped most-wanted lists everywhere for Christmas 2023.

The timer is also a great feature, meaning you can set it and nod off if you really want to.

My six-year-old daughter absolutely loves this doll and takes it everywhere.

The slimline hangers’ velvet texture stops clothes from slipping off, plus the hangers also rotate 360 degrees to fit in any space, and they can hold up to 5kg each.&nbsp;</p><p>Our Senior Lifestyle Editor <a href=#>Karen Silas</a> loves hers. “I switched to velvet hangers after moving into a new place with much less closet space - heavy and bulky wooden hangers are now banned in my wardrobe! The hangers are so slim that they save a ton of space and are perfect for hanging all of those pieces that have a tendency to slip off, like strappy tops and dresses. And you can buy these handy <a href=# rel=sponsored>velvet hanger clips</a> if you want to hang trousers or skirts, or hang pieces together. Plus they’re not too expensive, so it’s a win-win.”<br></p></li><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7f671892dc07-towe-air-fryer.jpg><p><h3 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">Tower deal</h3></p><p dir=ltr>If you’ve yet to join the air fryer party, Tower’s family-size model is a great option.

They are easy to clean, they reduce the formation of wrinkles, and are gentler on hair, because they reduce breakage, tangles, and frizz. Satin is also hypoallergenic and resistant to dust mites, making it a good choice for people with allergies or sensitive skin. Snap up this set in the Amazon sale - they're available in practically every colour you could want, too!<br></p></li><h2 dir=ltr>How Are Amazon Product Star Ratings Calculated?</h2><p id=ef_7tUOCFz data-wc=79>It’s more than a simple average of customer ratings - Amazon calculates this using machine-learned models, which take into account factors such as how recent the rating or review is and verified purchase status. (This is when Amazon has confirmed that the reviewer bought the item on Amazon and paid a price available to most Amazon shoppers) Amazon’s rating system continues to learn and improve over time, so you can be sure that the rating is up-to-date and accurate.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">KEEP SHOPPING</h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfqLWwvM%2BipaBnZWWFdn%2BQaJmeq6Rirq6t2ailZquRobJusMismqitnqnAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
