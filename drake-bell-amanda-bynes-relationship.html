Yet, after a promising start to a career in film with "She's the Man" and "Hairspray" for example, Bynes began behaving strangely. She later confessed this was all from using drugs. Still, she and her old sidekick Drake Bell stayed in touch long after "The Amanda Show" ended in the early aughts.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>"Amanda and I are close," Bell told <a href=#>OK!</a>&nbsp;"We worked together for years. I talk to her every day. She's a sweetheart. I had lunch with her yesterday, and she's brilliant. She's good, and she's healthy," Bell added. While the actor admitted that some of her behavior may seem erratic, he didn't have any cause for concern for her mental health. In fact, he continued to suggest the two meet up whenever he was in town. "She's the same beautiful, funny, artistic, thoughtful person that she's always been," Bell explained.</p><p>As <a href=#>Bynes continued to make news after her retirement from acting</a>, she could at least count on Bell to support her. Following the end of her 9-year conservatorship in 2022, Bell said the two still talked. "I reached out to her a while ago. I hope she's doing OK," Bell told <a href=#>TMZ</a>. He wished Bynes well, especially because "she's been a good friend for years."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamplboN0hY6dqZqjlWKvprjLZpimmZ6Zrm6u2KecrGWimrmiwMiopaygmaV8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
