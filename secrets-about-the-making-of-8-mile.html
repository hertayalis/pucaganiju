Eli Reed/Imagine/Universal/Kobal/Shutterstock Like so many precocious youngsters who hit it out of the park when they're 7, Chloe Greenfield—who made her acting debut in 8 Mile playing Jimmy's little sister, Lily, basically the one person who doesn't piss him off at some point—eventually put the profession on the back burner.
&#34;I never really set out to be an actor,&#34; the Twitter-described herbalist and activist said on the Dec. 13, 2020, episode of the podcast Setting the Tone."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Detroit, in 2000, having any kind of filming was uncommon at that time, so it was like an event."</p><p>Greenfield estimated there were a couple hundred other kids there,&nbsp;taking Polaroids while grown-ups filled out the paperwork. "Right&nbsp;when we were about to leave," she recalled, "a production assistant came up to us and asked my mom if she could do a screen test on me...And pretty soon after that we were filming&nbsp;8 Mile. So that was my first audition ever, which wasn't really an audition."</p><p>For the next few years her family went back and forth to L.A. for pilot season and auditioned for but didn't get parts in films such as&nbsp;Cheaper by the Dozen.&nbsp;But when she was 11 she did score&nbsp;a guest-starring appearance on&nbsp;ER, which turned into a&nbsp;three-season run playing Sarah, the adoptive daughter of <strong><a href=#>John Stamos</a></strong>' Dr. Tony Gates, from 2006 to 2009, after which she moved on to other pursuits,&nbsp;starting with high school and then college.</p><p>"I got the chance to be a stupid kid and make my mistakes, and grow up and not be in the public eye," she reflected on&nbsp;Setting the Tone, noting that she was open to future acting opportunities and still went on auditions here and there. "For my overall life, that was fantastic."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7prvNpaCnnV6YvK57z6GmraejZIB2fpdrZqydk6eytb%2BMmpmoraRiwamxjKaYpKGenHqwsoxxZKahnJo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
