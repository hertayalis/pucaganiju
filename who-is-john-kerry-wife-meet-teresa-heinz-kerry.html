Born to a wealthy and influential family in Aurora, Colorado, Kerry’s inclination to politics and diplomacy comes from his father, who was a marine and foreign service diplomat.</p><p>His educational career was completed in some of the world’s best and most elite boarding schools and universities. After graduating from Yale in 1966, he enlisted in the Naval Reserve.</p><p>John Kerry has a Silver and Purple Star from his three years of military service. After returning from the war, he joined the Vietnam Veterans Against the War (V.V.A.W.), a non-profit organization against the State Department’s official policy in the Vietnam war.</p><p>He is credited with giving Barack Obama the podium. After 2006, he was almost out of politics, but in 2012, Barack Obama asked him to be his foreign secretary. His Foreign secretary tenure was considered better than Hillary Clinton’s tenure.&nbsp; He is credited with avoiding the Syrian War.</p><p>He is a former Secretary of State, former senator for Massechuchets, and the Democratic presidential nominee for 2004. Kerry has been regarded as a level-headed public servant who has struck deals by reaching across the aisle and bringing tenacious parties together.</p><p>John Kerry’s political career started with a failed congressional run in 1972. A decade later, the newly minted lawyer and Assistant District Attorney won the Lieutenant Governor election on the Democratic ticket with Michael Dukakis.</p><p>In 1984, he was elected as the senator of Massachusetts, a seat he held until 2012. His style of leadership can be termed empowering, focused, and goal-oriented. As one of the most liberal senators in the Democrat party, Kerry has always been a vocal supporter of women’s rights. His keen focus on the environment landed him the role of becoming America’s first climate envoy.</p><p>Kerry’s many accomplishments as a distinguished statesman and top diplomat include the 2014 Palestine-Isreal Peace Talks, the successful negotiation of the Iran nuclear deal, and the Paris Climate Agreement, and raising awareness about the threat of climate change. In his late 70s, he maintains the vigor and enthusiasm of a beginner.</p><p>Kerry has been a public servant for nearly 50 years. Hailing from a wealthy family, he had plenty of routes to pursue. But his heart stayed committed to service. He has served his country as a marine, lieutenant governor, a senator, secretary of state, and now as the climate envoy.</p><p>Kerry has fought against the politics of selfishness and the belief that women shouldn’t be treated as equal benefactors of society. He has been a champion of women’s rights throughout his political career. He has supported gender equality legislation and has been a vocal supporter of a woman’s right to choose.</p><p>John Kerry Net worth is 280 million dollars.</p><p>John Kerry is the second of four&nbsp;children&nbsp;born to Richard&nbsp;John Kerry, a U.S. diplomat and lawyer, and Rosemary Forbes, a nurse and social activist.</p><p>He has two&nbsp;children&nbsp;and three step-children.
