Source: Warner Bros. The hot-as-can-be Barbie movie has all sorts of surprises in store for fans, young and older.
One campy aspect of the highly-anticipated Greta Gerwig film is that many discontinued Barbies make appearances.
From Allan, Ken's former wing man, to Barbie Video Girl, the ill-fated doll that was pulled over FBI safety concerns, read on to see which of the Mattel dolls from the past you remember, and to decide if you think that parents were right to be upset over their mere existence on store shelves."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But the male Barbie, whose partner was Midge — more on her in a moment — was ultimately discontinued. Sorry, Allan.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pregnant Midge</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p>Portrayed by the astounding <a href=#>Emerald Fennell</a> in the film, Midge is no longer on store shelves. Most of us know the doll as Barbie's BFF, but some will recall how she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">created controversy in 2002</a> upon being released as a pregnant doll, complete with an, ahem, removable baby.</p><p>The doll, who was married to the longgone Allan, was also part of a Happy Family set, which likewise is no more.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Growing Up Skipper</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Skipper, or Barbie Junior, is the main doll's little sister.</p><p>But when a Growing Up Skipper (Hannah Khalique-Brown) was released <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">circa 1975</a>, featuring the ability to grow breasts in the twist of her arm, unsurprisingly, the toy was banned ASAP.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Teen Talk Barbie</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>She sounds innocent enough, but Teen Talk Barbie (Marisa Abela) apparently spouted some rather anti-feminist jargon upon being released in 1992.</p><p>Per , this Barbie doll said stuff like “Let’s plan our dream wedding!” and “Math class is tough!” And parents didn't like her, so bye bye.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Earring Magic Ken</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p>Tom Stourton plays the discontinued Earring Magic Ken in the film, and as fans will recall, this Ken featured a single earring and a see-through purple mesh shirt, and faux leather vest.</p><p>The doll became an icon for the LGBTQ+ community, but was ultimately not so popular, and therefore, not available on store shelves.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Palm Beach Sugar Daddy Ken</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>This one should be pretty self-explanatory. While Palm Beach Sugar Daddy Ken (<a href=#>Rob Brydon</a>) was actually the dad of a dog named Sugar per Mashable, the double meaning behind his name wasn't a good fit with parents, and thus, the doll was short lived.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Barbie Video Girl</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p>Last but not least on our hit list of Barbies who are no more is Barbie Video Girl, a seemingly innocuous iteration of the famous doll.</p><p>But the doll wasn't just a fan of music videos or something. She actually had a video recording device inside of her that was intended to enable kids to make short videos of their playtime.</p><p>But as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR</a> reports, the FBI issued a warning about the doll in 2010 over concerns that Barbie Video Girl could be used in making child pornorgraphy. And so, this Barbie went the way of Allan, Sugar Daddy Ken, and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmba0r86nq6KmpZqxbq7Aq5minaNitq95wZqpm6GVYrqwwsie</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
