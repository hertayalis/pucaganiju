Mahl had apparently gotten into a fight with another lady as they argued over an ex-boyfriend. Brooks continued talking to her and realized that she went to the same university as him. The two ended up staying in touch and got close during their time at Oklahoma State University, courting each other and falling in love.&nbsp;</p><p>The two went through a rough patch when Brooks moved to Nashville but got back together once he returned. They tied the knot on <a href=#>May 24, 1986</a> in Oklahoma. Sadly, after 14 years with each other, the couple decided to call it quits in <a href=#>2000</a>.&nbsp;Brooks said that he would do his best to be a good father to their kids. He said, "I want to try and become for them what my Dad was and still is for me."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCCl2ppamhfqbWmedSnq6iklGLBs8HToWSonl2crrPAx2aZq6efoMBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
