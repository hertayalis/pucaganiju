In some clips from his early days on "<a href=#>"Wild 'N Out"</a>," which he joined at age 19 in 2015, he's still sporting his natural teeth. On "Off the Vine," he said that he didn't like their original size, but that wasn't his only issue with their appearance. "I had Ohio teeth," said the Buckeye State native. "Picture a fence with missing boards ... I had gaps between a bunch of different ones." Rife also told Bristowe that he was thrilled with the results of the dental work he had done.</p><p>In a 2018 <a href=#>Instagram</a> post, Rife revealed that he put his mouth in the capable hands of Hollywood dentist Dr. Kourosh Maddahi, whose celebrity clients include model Olivia Culpo&nbsp;and actor Bella Thorne. "I'd rather have died than smile. But thanks to him I can smile anywhere; his office, a funeral, planned parenthood, etc.," Rife wrote of his smile savior. The comedian even filmed <a href=#>a video</a> for Maddahi's social media accounts praising his work. In it, Rife reveals that he has veneers on eight of his front teeth&nbsp;and says that getting them cemented on was a painless experience.</p><p>According to Rife, comedians Dane Cook and Jo Koy recommended Maddahi to him. During an appearance on <a href=#>"Bertcast,"</a>&nbsp;he said that he made enough money to pay for his veneers when he toured with late comedian Ralphie May.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtlZoR2fo6aqZ5lnZbBtXnRop2eZaSasrW0jKucmqRf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
