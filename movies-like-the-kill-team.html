Buffalo Soldiers (2001)</h2><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=791365 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/movies-like-the-kill-team/buffalo-soldiers/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Buffalo-Soldiers-.jpeg data-orig-size=1088,465 data-comments-opened=0 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="Buffalo Soldiers" data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Buffalo-Soldiers-.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Buffalo-Soldiers-.jpeg?w=1024" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Buffalo-Soldiers-.jpeg alt width=1024 height=438 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Starring <a href=#>Joaquin Phoenix</a>, ‘Buffalo Soldiers’ is one of the most underrated war films to have ever been made. A satirical dark comedy, the film is set in 1989, just before the fall of the Berlin Wall. It follows the story of a group of U.S. Army soldiers stationed at a military base in West Germany. These soldiers, nicknamed “Buffalo Soldiers,” are mainly involved in non-combat activities and often find themselves bored and without much to do. To pass the time, they engage in various illegal activities, including black market dealings, theft, and drug use. Much like “The Kill Team,” the film delves into the recklessness of soldiers during times of war and the sense of impermanence and detachment from the consequences of their actions. Both films shed light on the psychological toll and moral dilemmas faced by individuals in military settings and highlight the chaos and absurdity that can prevail in such environments.</p><h2 style=text-align:center>3.
