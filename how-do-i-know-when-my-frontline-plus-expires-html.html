This, on the other hand, is an indication that the treatment is effective. Flies are attracted to the top of the hair coat by Frontline, which makes it easier to notice them. Frontline makes fleas hyperactive before killing them.</p><p></p><h3>Is it true that flea medication has an expiration date?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>When it comes to “expired” drugs, veterinarians receive a lot of calls.

FRONTLINE Plus is effective for 30 days, regardless of whether or not your pet swims or is washed during that time. Keep your pet out of the water for at least 24 hours after applying the product.</p><p></p><h3>There were 36 related questions and answers found.</h3><p></p><h3>Will Frontline that is out of date continue to function?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Hello, Erica.

In spite of the fact that Frontline Plus is marketed as waterproof, I always recommend that my customers wait at least 24 to 48 hours before washing their pets.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p></p><h3>What should you do if the frontline isn’t working?</h3><p>Give a Boost to the Frontline If you don’t have a flea shampoo on hand, a wash with standard dog shampoo will be sufficient to rid your dog of the majority of the fleas. It is recommended that you wait at least 48 hours after administering Frontline Plus to your puppy before bathing him in water.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is it possible to reapply for Frontline before the deadline?</h3><p>If you discover fleas on your pet after using your pet’s topical flea medication, you may want to consider reapplying it as soon as you discover them.
